# SE-Assignment-6

# Answers
 
1. Python Basics:

   What is Python? Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It emphasizes code readability with its clear syntax, making it easier for beginners and experienced programmers to understand and maintain projects.

   Key Features:

   - Easy to Learn: Python's syntax is close to natural language, making it easier to learn than many other programming languages.
   Large Standard Library: Python comes with a vast collection of pre-written code (modules) for common tasks, saving developers time.
   - Cross-Platform: Python code can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python supports OOP, allowing for organized and reusable code.
   - Dynamic Typing: Variable types are checked at runtime, making development faster.
   - Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, making debugging easier.

   Use Cases:

   - Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask are used to build websites and web applications.
   - Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn are essential for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
   - Automation and Scripting: Python's simplicity makes it ideal for automating repetitive tasks and writing scripts.
   - Education: It's a popular language for teaching programming due to its easy learning curve.

2. Installing Python:

   Steps:
      - Download: Get the latest Python installer from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
      - Run Installer: Follow the on-screen instructions. Ensure you check the "Add Python to PATH" option for easier command-line access.
      - Verify Installation: Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and type python --version. You should see the installed Python version.
      - Virtual Environment (Optional):
      ```
         python -m venv myenv (Creates a new environment named 'myenv')
         myenv\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source myenv/bin/activate (macOS/Linux) to activate.
      ```
3. Python Syntax and Semantics (Hello, World!):
   ```
      print("Hello, World!")
   ```
   Explanation:
      - print(): A built-in function to display output on the console.
      - ("Hello, World!"): The text string (in quotes) to be printed.

4. Data Types and Variables:

   Basic Data Types:

      - Integers (int): Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10)
      - Floating-Point Numbers (float): Numbers with decimals (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)
      - Strings (str): Text enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello", "Python")
      - Booleans (bool): Represent True or False values
      - None: Represents the absence of a value

   Example:
      ```
         age = 30      # Integer
         price = 19.99  # Float
         name = "Alice"  # String
         is_student = True  # Boolean

         print(age, price, name, is_student)  
      ```
5. Control Structures (if-else and for loop):
   ```
      grade = 85
      if grade >= 90:
         print("Excellent")
      elif grade >= 80:
         print("Good")
      else:
         print("Average")

      for i in range(5): 
         print(i)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
   ```
6. Functions in Python:

   What are functions? Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help you organize your code
   make it more readable, and avoid repetition.

   Why are they useful?

      - Modularity: They break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.
      - Reusability: Functions can be called multiple times from different parts of your code.
      - Abstraction: They hide the implementation details, focusing on what the function does, not how it does it.

   Example (Function to calculate sum):
      ```
         def add_numbers(a, b):  
            sum = a + b
            return sum  

         result = add_numbers(5, 3) 
         print(result)  # Output: 8
      ```
7. Lists and Dictionaries:

   Lists: Ordered collections of items that can be of different types. You can modify them after creation (mutable).
      ```
         numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Create a list of numbers
         numbers.append(6)  # Add an item to the end
         print(numbers[0])   # Access the first element (output: 1)
      ```
   Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique. Dictionaries are also mutable.
      ```
         person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'} 
         print(person['name'])  # Access value by key (output: 'Alice')
         person['age'] = 31    # Modify a value
      ```
8. Exception Handling:

   What is exception handling? It's a way to deal with errors (exceptions) that may occur during program execution. Python uses try-except blocks to catch and handle these errors gracefully.

   Example:
      ```
         try:
            result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
         except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Error: Division by zero")
         finally:
            print("This code will always execute") 
      ```

9. Modules and Packages:

   Modules: Files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that you can reuse in other programs.

   Packages: Directories containing multiple modules, often used to organize large projects.

   Importing Modules: Use the import statement.

   Example (Using the math module):
      ```
         import math

         x = 5
         print(math.sqrt(x))   # Calculate the square root of 5
      ```

10. File I/O:

   Reading from a file:
      ```
         with open("my_file.txt", "r") as file: 
            content = file.read()
            print(content)
      ```

   Writing to a file:
      ```
         data = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
         with open("output.txt", "w") as file: 
            for item in data:
               file.write(item + "\n")
      ```
